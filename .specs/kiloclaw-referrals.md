# KiloClaw Referral Program

## Role of This Document

This spec defines the business rules and invariants for the KiloClaw referral program powered by Impact Advocate. It is
the source of truth for _what_ the system must guarantee -- who is eligible, how referral attribution competes with
affiliate attribution, when referral conversions occur, how rewards are granted and fulfilled, and how the system behaves
when Impact Advocate or billing integrations are unavailable. It deliberately does not prescribe _how_ to implement those
guarantees: handler names, column layouts, retry strategies, and other implementation choices belong in plan documents
and code, not here.

## Status

## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
"NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119]
[RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Definitions

- **Impact Advocate**: The Impact.com referral product used to generate share links, register referral participants,
  attribute referred users, and report referral lifecycle and reward events.
- **Impact Performance Program**: The existing Impact.com affiliate/conversion program for KiloClaw, CampaignId `50754`.
- **Advocate Program**: The Impact Advocate referral program for KiloClaw, ProgramId `51699`.
- **UTT (Universal Tracking Tag)**: A JavaScript snippet provided by Impact.com that enables client-side tracking,
  first-party cookies, and identity bridging.
- **Advocate widget**: The Impact Verified Access in-app widget `p/51699/w/referrerWidget` used by logged-in users to
  access referral share links and referral status.
- **Referrer**: An existing user who shares a referral link and may earn a referral reward when an eligible referee
  converts.
- **Referee**: A referred user who arrives through a referral link, creates a Kilo account, and may earn a referral
  reward after their first eligible paid KiloClaw conversion.
- **Referral touch**: A captured Impact Advocate attribution interaction, including `_saasquatch` and related referral
  parameters or cookies. The value is opaque to Kilo.
- **Valid referral touch**: A referral touch with a non-empty `_saasquatch` value, associated with the converting user's
  pre-signup session or user record, where `conversion_time < touched_at + 30 * 24 hours` using server UTC timestamps.
- **Affiliate touch**: A captured Impact affiliate interaction, including the `im_ref` click identifier. The value is
  opaque to Kilo.
- **Sale-attributed affiliate touch**: An affiliate touch already used to report a specific SALE conversion to Impact.
  This protects that specific reported SALE from retroactive referral override, but it does not make the affiliate touch
  win unrelated future referral-priority decisions.
- **Attribution touch**: Either a referral touch or affiliate touch considered by KiloClaw conversion-time attribution
  resolution.
- **Valid touch**: An attribution touch that has not expired, belongs to the converting user or their pre-signup session,
  and is eligible for the conversion being evaluated.
- **Referral-priority attribution**: The attribution model for KiloClaw referral/affiliate conflict resolution: at
  conversion time, a valid referral touch wins over an affiliate touch unless that affiliate touch is sale-attributed for
  the same SALE conversion being evaluated.
- **First paid KiloClaw conversion**: The referee's first confirmed paid personal KiloClaw subscription payment period,
  whether funded by Stripe settlement, hybrid settlement, or pure-credit deduction. Trial start does not qualify.
- **Monetized KiloClaw payment period**: A KiloClaw billing period with positive Stripe-settled value, positive hybrid
  settled value, or positive credit deduction. Zero-dollar invoices, fully comped periods, and admin adjustments are not
  monetized payment periods.
- **Free-month reward**: A local KiloClaw billing reward that delays the beneficiary's next KiloClaw renewal by one
  calendar month. It is not a general account credit.
- **Calendar month**: A billing-period extension that preserves the day-of-month semantics of the current KiloClaw billing
  calendar, clamping to the last valid day of the target month when necessary.
- **Reward beneficiary**: A user who may receive a free-month reward. Beneficiary roles are `referrer` and `referee`.
- **Reward state**: A durable lifecycle state for a reward. Required states are `pending`, `earned`, `applied`,
  `reversed`, `expired`, `canceled`, and `review_required`.
- **Active eligible personal KiloClaw subscription**: A personal KiloClaw subscription that is active, not canceling at
  period end, not suspended, and not past due.
- **Personal KiloClaw subscription**: A KiloClaw subscription owned by an individual user. Organization/team-scoped
  KiloClaw subscriptions are not eligible.
- **Brand-new Kilo account**: A user identity with no current or historical Kilo user identity under the configured
  identity key before the referral touch. Adding an auth provider to an existing user is not brand-new.
- **Reward-bearing referral configuration**: The environment configuration required to create referral touches, register
  Advocate participants, report Impact conversions, grant local rewards, and apply KiloClaw billing extensions.
- **Chargeback**: A Stripe dispute event for the qualifying Stripe payment.
- **Fraud-marked payment**: A qualifying payment marked fraudulent by Stripe, an internal fraud process, or an authorized
  operator.
- **Support review**: A durable `review_required` reward state with the triggering reason, affected billing period, and
  source payment or dispute recorded.
- **Impact-facing status field**: Local status retained only to compare Kilo state with Impact dashboard exports or API
  reads; it cannot drive eligibility, reward granting, or billing fulfillment.

## Overview

The KiloClaw referral program is a double-sided program: when an eligible existing user refers an eligible new KiloClaw
subscriber, the referrer and referee each earn one free KiloClaw month. A reward is earned only after the referee's first
confirmed paid personal KiloClaw subscription payment. The reward is fulfilled by delaying the beneficiary's next
KiloClaw renewal by one calendar month.

Impact Advocate owns the referral sharing experience, share links, referral cookies, participant registration, and
Advocate program reporting. Kilo owns product eligibility, affiliate/referral attribution conflict resolution,
first-paid-conversion detection, reward grant idempotency, reward caps, and billing fulfillment.

Impact Advocate conversion state is driven through the existing Impact Performance Program conversion events. The system
uses `Sale (71659)` as the paid-conversion event for paid KiloClaw periods, including renewals.

This program applies only to personal KiloClaw subscriptions. Organization-scoped KiloClaw instances, team plans, admin
interventions, and non-KiloClaw purchases are out of scope.

## Rules

### Program Configuration

1. The system MUST treat the following identifiers as configuration constants for this integration:
   - Impact Account: `7138521`
   - Impact Performance CampaignId: `50754`
   - Impact Advocate ProgramId: `51699`
   - UTT UUID: `A7138521-9724-4b8f-95f4-1db2fbae81141`
   - Advocate widget ID: `p/51699/w/referrerWidget`

2. The system MUST use the existing Impact Performance conversion action tracker IDs for KiloClaw lifecycle reporting:

   | Event       | ActionTrackerId | Trigger                                       |
   | ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
   | VISIT       | 71668           | Visitor lands on `kilo.ai` with `im_ref`      |
   | SIGNUP      | 71655           | New user creation with attribution            |
   | TRIAL_START | 71656           | KiloClaw trial subscription becomes active    |
   | TRIAL_END   | 71658           | KiloClaw trial subscription ends (any reason) |
   | SALE        | 71659           | Monetized KiloClaw payment period is funded   |

3. The system MUST keep Impact Advocate API credentials server-side. Credentials MUST NOT be exposed to the browser.

4. If Impact Advocate configuration is absent, referral sharing, participant registration, and Impact reconciliation MAY
   be disabled, but the application MUST continue to function normally.

5. If reward-bearing referral configuration is absent in an environment where the referral program is enabled, the system
   MUST fail closed for reward issuance and MUST log the configuration failure. It MUST NOT silently mark rewards or
   Impact work as completed.

6. Referral UTT loading is controlled by the application's public Impact UTT configuration for the active environment.

### Advocate Experience

7. Logged-in users MUST access referral sharing through the Impact Verified Access widget.

8. The system MUST authenticate users to Impact Advocate using the configured Verified Access contract.

9. The Impact Advocate identity contract for Kilo is: `id = Kilo user ID`, `accountId = Kilo user ID`, and
   `email = plain user email`.

10. The system MUST NOT allow users to alter the identity payload used to establish Advocate identity.

### Client-Side Tracking and Identity

11. The system MUST load the Impact UTT script on pages used by the referral program when the UTT identifier is
    configured, and MUST NOT load it when the UTT identifier is not configured.

12. The system MUST invoke Impact `identify` on pages used by the referral program.

13. Anonymous `identify` calls MUST pass empty string values for unknown `customerId` and `customerEmail`. The system
    MUST NOT pass `undefined`, `null`, placeholders, or fake identifiers for unknown users.

14. Logged-in `identify` calls MUST pass a stable customer identifier and SHA-1 hashed email.

15. `identify` calls MUST include a stable `customProfileId` derived from the Kilo user ID for logged-in users and a
    stable first-party anonymous ID for anonymous users.

16. The system MUST treat `_saasquatch`, `rsCode`, `rsShareMedium`, `rsEngagementMedium`, `im_ref`, and related tracking
    values as opaque. The system MUST NOT parse, validate the internal format of, or assign meaning to these values.

17. Opaque tracking values MUST have a documented maximum accepted length, MUST be stored as UTF-8 strings, and MUST be
    ignored for attribution when they exceed that maximum. Logs MUST redact or truncate opaque tracking values.

### Referral Touch Capture

18. When a visitor lands with Impact Advocate referral attribution, the system MUST capture the referral touch before or
    during user creation.

19. A referral touch is valid for attribution only when it contains a non-empty `_saasquatch` value. If `_saasquatch` is
    absent, the system MAY preserve related metadata for diagnostics but MUST NOT treat it as a valid referral touch.

20. A referral touch SHOULD include related opaque metadata when available, including `rsCode`, `rsShareMedium`,
    `rsEngagementMedium`, UTM parameters, and sanitized landing path.

21. Referral touch capture MUST preserve attribution across the authentication flow, including OAuth redirects and
    callback URLs.

22. Referral touches MUST expire 30 days after the touch time. A touch is valid only when
    `conversion_time < touched_at + 30 * 24 hours`, using server UTC timestamps. A touch at or after that instant is
    expired.

23. The system MUST associate pre-signup referral touches with the created user during signup or first authenticated
    request after signup.

24. Capturing or associating a referral touch MUST NOT grant a reward.

25. If a user arrives with multiple referral touches, the system MUST preserve enough chronological information to
    resolve referral-priority attribution at conversion time.

### Affiliate and Referral Attribution Priority

26. KiloClaw referral rewards and KiloClaw affiliate attribution MUST share a 30-day conversion-time attribution window.

27. At first paid KiloClaw conversion time, the system MUST evaluate valid affiliate and referral touches together.

28. For KiloClaw conversions governed by this referral spec, this spec's referral-priority attribution overrides the
    permanent first-touch affiliate attribution rules in `.specs/impact-affiliate-tracking.md`.

29. A valid referral touch MUST win over a valid affiliate touch unless that affiliate touch is sale-attributed for the
    same SALE conversion being evaluated. A sale-attributed affiliate touch protects only the already-reported SALE from
    retroactive referral override. It MUST NOT be reused to win a later conversion unless that later conversion is also
    independently attributed to the affiliate under this spec.

30. If multiple valid referral touches exist and no same-SALE sale-attributed affiliate touch is present, the oldest valid
    referral touch MUST win.

31. If no valid referral touch exists, the oldest valid affiliate touch MUST win.

32. If all touches are expired or invalid, neither affiliate attribution nor referral rewards win for that conversion.

33. If an affiliate touch wins, the system MUST NOT grant referral rewards for that conversion.

34. If a referral touch wins, the system MUST NOT attribute that first paid KiloClaw conversion to an affiliate for reward
    or payout purposes.

35. The system MUST record when an affiliate touch has been attributed to a SALE conversion so future referral-priority
    resolution can preserve that specific sale attribution.

36. The system MUST implement at least the following attribution outcomes:

| Scenario                                                                            | Expected winner |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Affiliate first, referral second, both valid, affiliate not attributed to this SALE | Referral        |
| Affiliate first, referral second, both valid, affiliate attributed to this SALE     | Affiliate       |
| Referral first, affiliate second, both valid, affiliate not attributed to this SALE | Referral        |
| Referral first, affiliate second, both valid, affiliate attributed to this SALE     | Affiliate       |
| Only affiliate valid                                                                | Affiliate       |
| Only referral valid                                                                 | Referral        |
| All touches expired or invalid                                                      | None            |

37. Attribution resolution for referral rewards MUST happen at conversion time, not only at signup time.

38. Impact-side attribution MUST NOT override local eligibility, reward caps, or billing fulfillment decisions.

### Referred Participant Registration

39. When a new user signs up with `_saasquatch` attribution, the system MUST attempt to register or upsert the user as a
    referred participant in Impact Advocate.

40. Register Participant requests MUST be made server-side.

41. Register Participant requests MUST pass the captured `_saasquatch` value as opaque cookie attribution.

42. Register Participant requests SHOULD include locale and country code when available.

43. If `_saasquatch` is present during signup, referral touch association and participant registration enqueueing MUST
    occur before signup is considered complete, but external Impact delivery MUST NOT block user access.

44. Register Participant failures MUST be recorded for retry or reconciliation.

45. Transient participant registration failures MUST leave the registration in a retryable state until it succeeds, is
    superseded by a corrected payload, or is marked permanently failed by an operator-visible terminal state.

46. Register Participant requests that fail with client errors MUST be logged and MUST NOT be retried until the request
    payload or configuration is corrected.

47. Register Participant requests MUST use the Kilo user ID for Advocate `id` and `accountId`.

48. Register Participant requests MUST include plain-text email only as the Advocate contact email.

### Referee Eligibility

49. A referee MUST be a brand-new Kilo account to qualify for referral rewards.

50. Existing users MUST NOT qualify as referees, even if they later click a referral link.

51. Adding an auth provider to an existing Kilo user MUST NOT qualify as a brand-new Kilo account.

52. Previously deleted users MUST NOT qualify as referees. Previously deleted user disqualification MUST use a
    legal-approved normalized-email hash tombstone.

53. A referee MUST convert on a personal KiloClaw subscription. Team plans, organization-scoped KiloClaw subscriptions,
    and non-KiloClaw subscriptions MUST NOT qualify.

54. A referee MUST make a first confirmed paid KiloClaw subscription payment before either side earns a reward.

55. The first confirmed paid KiloClaw subscription payment MUST fund a monetized KiloClaw payment period.

56. Trial start, trial end, account signup, widget registration, zero-dollar invoices, fully comped periods, admin
    adjustments, or referral touch capture MUST NOT qualify as a paid referral conversion.

57. A referee's renewals after the first paid KiloClaw conversion MUST NOT generate additional referral rewards.

58. A user MUST NOT refer themselves. The system MUST disqualify a referral when the referrer and referee resolve to the
    same Kilo user.

59. Fraudulent, test, admin-created, or manually adjusted subscriptions MUST NOT qualify for referral rewards unless an
    authorized operator explicitly marks the conversion as eligible under a documented support process.

### Referrer Eligibility

60. A referrer MUST be a Kilo user registered or registerable as an Impact Advocate participant.

61. A referrer MUST have an active eligible personal KiloClaw subscription when the reward is earned.

62. A referrer without an active eligible personal KiloClaw subscription at reward-earn time MUST be disqualified for that
    referrer reward. The disqualification MUST be recorded.

63. A referrer MUST NOT receive more than 12 total free-month rewards from the referral program.

64. The referrer cap MUST be enforced before granting a referrer reward.

65. The 12-month referrer cap MUST be enforced atomically across concurrent reward grants. Concurrent processing MUST NOT
    produce more than 12 granted referrer reward months.

66. When a qualified referral occurs after the referrer has reached the 12-month cap, the system MUST record that the
    referrer reward was cap-limited and MUST NOT grant another referrer free month.

67. Referee rewards MUST NOT count against the referrer's 12-month cap.

### Reward Granting

68. A qualified referral conversion MUST grant one free-month reward to the referee.

69. A qualified referral conversion MUST grant one free-month reward to the referrer. The reward MUST be marked
    cap-limited instead of granted when the referrer cap has been reached or another referrer eligibility rule prevents
    it.

70. Referral reward granting MUST be idempotent. Processing the same qualifying conversion multiple times MUST NOT create
    duplicate rewards for the same beneficiary role.

71. For a qualified referral, reward grant processing MUST be atomic across both beneficiary reward decisions. Both
    beneficiary outcomes MUST be recorded together, including granted, cap-limited, and disqualified outcomes.

72. Reward records MUST identify the source referral, source conversion, beneficiary user, beneficiary role, number of
    months granted, status, and relevant timestamps.

73. Reward records MUST support the reward states defined in this spec.

74. A reward MUST NOT be considered fulfilled until the corresponding KiloClaw renewal has been delayed.

75. Impact Advocate reward state MAY be used for reconciliation, support, or reporting. It MUST NOT be the source of
    truth for local free-month fulfillment.

### Reward Fulfillment and Billing

76. Free-month rewards MUST be fulfilled by delaying a KiloClaw renewal by one calendar month per reward.

77. An earned reward applies to the beneficiary's next unpaid renewal boundary after the reward is earned. It MUST NOT
    modify already-finalized invoices or already-funded periods.

78. Free-month rewards MUST NOT be fulfilled as general account credits.

79. Free-month rewards MUST apply to KiloClaw billing only. They MUST NOT apply to inference usage, Kilo Pass, team plans,
    or non-KiloClaw purchases.

80. Multiple free-month rewards MAY stack. Each applied reward MUST delay renewal by exactly one calendar month.

81. For month-to-month KiloClaw subscriptions, one reward MUST delay the next monthly renewal by one calendar month.

82. For six-month commitment KiloClaw subscriptions, one reward MUST delay the next six-month renewal by one calendar
    month. The reward MUST NOT convert the subscription to month-to-month and MUST NOT reduce the next invoice by one
    sixth.

83. For pure-credit KiloClaw subscriptions, reward application MUST update local renewal state so the credit renewal sweep
    does not deduct KiloClaw hosting credits until the extended renewal time.

84. For Stripe-funded or hybrid KiloClaw subscriptions, reward application MUST keep local billing state and Stripe
    billing state consistent. The system MUST NOT create a local-only renewal delay for a Stripe-funded subscription
    while allowing Stripe to charge on the original schedule.

85. Reward application MUST be idempotent. Retrying reward application MUST NOT extend the same subscription more than
    once for the same reward.

86. Reward application MUST record an audit trail containing the reward, beneficiary, affected subscription, previous
    renewal or period boundary, new renewal or period boundary, and any external billing operation identifiers.

87. Reward application MUST NOT break existing KiloClaw billing invariants for trials, pure-credit renewal, hybrid invoice
    settlement, commit plans, plan switching, cancellation, reactivation, past-due recovery, suspension, or destruction.

88. Reward application MUST respect cancellation state. If a subscription is canceled or canceling before reward
    application, the reward MUST remain pending until the beneficiary has an active eligible personal KiloClaw
    subscription.

### Impact Conversion Reporting

89. Impact Advocate referral conversion MUST be driven by the existing Impact Performance conversion events.

90. `Sale (71659)` MUST be the paid KiloClaw conversion event used for referral conversion and renewal reporting.

91. The system MUST NOT dispatch client-side `trackConversion` for referrals while server-side Performance conversion is
    the configured reporting mechanism.

92. When a referral wins attribution and the first paid conversion qualifies, the system MUST ensure Impact receives the
    required Performance conversion data for Advocate conversion reporting.

93. Conversion reporting MUST use deterministic order identifiers where possible so retries do not create duplicate Impact
    actions.

94. Conversion reporting failures MUST NOT block billing settlement, reward ledger creation, or user access. Failures MUST
    leave the conversion report in a retryable state until it succeeds, is superseded by a corrected payload, or is marked
    permanently failed by an operator-visible terminal state.

### Impact Reconciliation

95. The system MUST NOT rely on Impact Advocate webhooks for referral eligibility, reward granting, billing fulfillment,
    or reconciliation.

96. The system MAY use Impact dashboard exports or API reads for manual reconciliation and support investigations.

97. Impact reconciliation data MAY update local Impact-facing status fields, but it MUST NOT bypass local eligibility,
    cap, attribution, or billing fulfillment rules.

### Refunds, Reversals, and Fraud

98. Rewards from a qualifying Stripe payment MUST be canceled if Stripe reports a chargeback for that payment.

99. Pending or earned-but-unapplied rewards MUST be canceled when the qualifying Stripe payment is charged back.

100.  Already-applied rewards from a charged-back Stripe payment MUST be marked for support review and MUST NOT be silently
      clawed back.

101.  Rewards from refunded or fraud-marked payments MUST be canceled before application. Already-applied rewards from
      refunded or fraud-marked payments MUST be marked for support review and MUST NOT be silently clawed back.

102.  If a qualifying Impact action must be reversed, the system SHOULD use Impact's reverse-action mechanism instead of
      creating an unrelated negative conversion.

103.  Reversal and reward-cancellation handling MUST be idempotent.

### GDPR and PII

104. Referral tables that store user IDs, emails, referral relationships, IP addresses, referral cookies, Impact IDs, or
     reconciliation payloads MUST be included in GDPR soft-delete or anonymization flows.

105. GDPR deletion MUST delete or anonymize referral participant records, referral touch records, referral relationship
     records, reconciliation payloads containing PII, and reward records to the extent required by policy.

106. Plain email stored for Impact Advocate compatibility MUST be deleted or anonymized during GDPR deletion.

107. Previously deleted user disqualification MUST use a legal-approved non-PII tombstone or irreversible hash. The system
     MUST NOT retain PII solely for this purpose.

108. Referral tracking values MUST NOT be logged in a way that exposes secrets, auth headers, cookies, or unnecessary PII.

### Reliability and Isolation

109. Referral touch capture, participant registration, conversion reporting, reconciliation processing, and reward
     fulfillment failures MUST NOT break unrelated product functionality.

110. Reward ledger operations MUST be transactional where needed to prevent duplicate grants, partial grants, or missing
     audit records.

111. Reward fulfillment failures MUST leave rewards in a retryable state unless the failure is a permanent eligibility or
     configuration failure.

112. The system MUST expose enough operational state to distinguish pending Impact registration, pending Impact conversion
     reporting, pending local reward application, applied rewards, reversed rewards, canceled rewards, review-required
     rewards, and disqualified referrals.

113. Admin-only subscription interventions, internal test conversions, and support adjustments MUST NOT emit referral
     rewards or Impact referral conversions unless explicitly marked as eligible by an authorized operator.

### Existing Internal Referral System

114. The existing internal referral-code system MUST NOT grant additional KiloClaw referral rewards for conversions already
     governed by this spec.

115. Before launch, the existing internal referral system MUST be scoped away from KiloClaw, disabled for KiloClaw, or
     migrated into this program's rules to prevent double rewards.

## Error Handling

1. If referral touch capture fails, the system SHOULD log the failure and continue the primary request.

2. If Register Participant delivery fails with a server error or timeout, the system MUST leave the registration in a
   retryable state.

3. If Register Participant delivery fails with a client error, the system MUST log the error and MUST NOT retry unchanged
   payloads.

4. If Impact conversion reporting fails with a server error or timeout, the system MUST leave the report in a retryable
   state.

5. If Impact conversion reporting fails with a client error, the system MUST log the error and MUST NOT retry unchanged
   payloads.

6. If reward grant processing detects an ineligible referee, ineligible referrer, expired attribution, self-referral,
   exceeded cap, or non-personal subscription, the system MUST record the disqualification reason when a referral record
   exists.

7. If reward application fails after a reward is earned, the reward MUST remain retryable unless the failure is permanent
   and auditable.

8. If required billing state is ambiguous, the system MUST NOT apply a reward. It MUST leave the reward pending and log
   the ambiguity for investigation.
